# MTModding-CustomUnitSynthesisPatch
Foundation for Monster Train modding to resolve issue with creating custom units with custom synthesis upgrades through Trainworks.

While structured as a mod for Monster Train, the primary purpose of this project is to show an approach for creating a working framework for implementing custom units with custom synthesis upgrades for other mod projects that are using the Trainworks tool.
